# 4. The SOLID Principles

## 4-1. Single responsibility principle
The fact that the class has a sole responsibility means that it is in charge of doing just one concrete thing, and as a consequence of that, we can conclude that it must have only one reason to change.  
If, when looking at a class, we find methods that are mutually exclusive and do not relate to each other, they are the different responsibilities that have to be broken down into smaller classes.  

### (1) A class with too many responsibilities

| SystemMonitor |
| --- |
| +load_activity() |
| +identify_events() |
| +stream_events() |

```
# srp_1.py
class SystemMonitor:
    def load_activity(self):
        """Get the events from a source, to be processed."""

    def identify_events(self):
        """Parse the source raw data into events (domain objects)."""

    def stream_events(self):
        """Send the parsed events to an external agent."""
```
The problem with this class is that it defines an interface with a set of methods that correspond to actions that are orthogonal.

### (2) Distributing responsibilities

| AlertSystem | ActivityReader | SystemMonitor | Output |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| +run() | +load() | +identify_event() | +stream() |

This idea now is that changes on any of these classes do not impact the rest, and all of them have a clear and specific meaning.

## 4-2. The open/closed principle
The open/closed principle (OCP) states that a module should be open to extension but closed for modification.  
When requirements change, we want to just have to extend the module with the new required behavior in order to comply with the new requirements, but without having to modify the code.  

### (1) Example of maintainability perils for not followng the open/closed
```
# openclosed_1.py
class Event:
    def __init__(self, raw_data):
        self.raw_data = raw_data


class UnknownEvent(Event):
    """A type of event that cannot be identified from its data."""


class LoginEvent(Event):
    """An Event representing a user that has just entered the system."""


class LogoutEvent(Event):
    """An event representing a user that has just left the system."""


class SystemMonitor:
    """Identify events that occurred in the system."""

    def __init__(self, event_data):
        self.event_data = event_data

    def identify_event(self):
        if (self.event_data["before"]["session"] == 0
            and self.event_data["after"]["session"] == 1
        ):
            return LoginEvent(self.event_data)
        elif (self.event_data["before"]["session"] == 1
              and self.event_data["after"]["session"] == 0
        ):
            return LogoutEvent(self.event_data)

        return UnknownEvent(self.event_data)
```
```
>>> l1 = SystemMonitor({"before": {"session": 0}, "after": {"session": 1}})
>>> l1.identify_event().__class__.__name__
'LoginEvent'
>>> l2 = SystemMonitor({"before": {"session": 1}, "after": {"session": 0}})
>>> l2.identify_event().__class__.__name__
'LogoutEvent'
>>> l3 = SystemMonitor({"before": {"session": 1}, "after": {"session": 1}})
>>> l3.identify_event().__class__.__name__
'UnknownEvent'
```
We want to be able to add new types of event without having to change `identify_event` method(closed for modification).  
We also want to be able to support new types of event (open for extension) so that when a new event is added, we only have to add code, not change the code that already exists.  

### (2) Refactoring the events system for extensibility

| SystemMonitor | | Event | LoginEvent | LogoutEvent |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| +identify_event() | | +meets_condition() | +meets_condition() | +meets_condition() |

```
# openclosed_2.py
class Event:
    def __init__(self, raw_data):
        self.raw_data = raw_data

    @staticmethod
    def meets_condition(event_data: dict):
        return False


class UnknownEvent(Event):
    """A type of event that cannot be identified from its data"""


class LoginEvent(Event):
    @staticmethod
    def meets_condition(event_data: dict):
        return (
            event_data["before"]["session"] == 0
            and event_data["after"]["session"] == 1
        )


class LogoutEvent(Event):
    @staticmethod
    def meets_condition(event_data: dict):
        return (
            event_data["before"]["session"] == 1
            and event_data["after"]["session"] == 0
        )


class SystemMonitor:
    """Identify events that occurred in the system."""

    def __init__(self, event_data):
        self.event_data = event_data

    def identify_event(self):
        for event_cls in Event.__subclasses__():
            try:
                if event_cls.meets_condition(self.event_data):
                    return event_cls(self.event_data)
            except KeyError:
                continue
            return UnknownEvent(self.event_data)
```

### (3) Extending the events system
Now, only by adding the code to this new class does the logic keep working as expected:
```
# openclosed_3.py
...
class TransactionEvent(Event):
    """Represents a transaction that has just occurred on the system."""

    @staticmethod
    def meets_condition(event_data: dict):
        return event_data["after"].get("transaction") is not None

class SystemMonitor:
...
```
```
>>> l1 = SystemMonitor({"before": {"session": 0}, "after": {"session": 1}})
>>> l1.identify_event().__class__.__name__
'LoginEvent'
>>> l2 = SystemMonitor({"before": {"session": 1}, "after": {"session": 0}})
>>> l2.identify_event().__class__.__name__
'LogoutEvent'
>>> l3 = SystemMonitor({"before": {"session": 1}, "after": {"session": 1}})
>>> l3.identify_event().__class__.__name__
'UnknownEvent'
>>> l4 = SystemMonitor({"after": {"transaction": "Tx001"}})
>>> l4.identify_event().__class__.__name__
'TransactionEvent'
```
`SystemMonitor.identify_event()` method is closed with respect to new types of event.  
Conversely, the `event` class is open for an extension with respect to new types.  

### (4) Final thoughts about the OCP
In order to achieve this design, we need to be able to create proper closure against the abstractions we want to protect.  
In some cases of abstractions that might collide, we need to be selective and apply a strategy that provides the best closure for the types of requirement that require to be the most extensible.  

## 4-3. Liskov's substitution principle
Liskov's substitution principle (LSP) states that there is a series of properties that an object type must hold to preserve reliability on its design.  
The main idea behind LSP is that clients are completely isolated and unaware of changes in the class hierarchy.  

### (1) Detecting LSP issues with tools
- Detecting incorrect datatypes in method signatures with Mypy
If one of the subclasses of the baseclass were to override a method in an incompatible fashion, Mypy would notice this by inspecting the annotations:

```
class Event:
    ...
    def meets_condition(self, event_data:cict) -> bool:
        return False

class LoginEvent(Event):
    def meets_condition(self, event_data:list) -> bool:
        return bool(event_data)
```
> error: Argument 1 of "meets_condition" incompatible with supertype "Event"

- Detecting incompatible signatures with Pylint
Another strong violation of LSP is when the signatures of the methods differ completely.  

```
# lsp_1.py
class LogoutEvent(Event):
    def meets_condition(self, event_data: dict, override: bool) -> bool:
        if override:
            return True
        ...
```
> Parameters differ from overridden 'meets_condition' method (argumentsdiffer)

### (2) More subtle cases of LSP violations
Given that the entire idea of LSP is that subclasses can be used by clients just like their parent class, it must also be true that contracts are correctly preserved on the hierarchy.

### (3) Remarks on the LSP
