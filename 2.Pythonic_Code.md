# 2. Pythonic code

### 2-1. Creating your own sequence
(1) a wrapper around a standard library object(encapsulation)
- call all of the same methods on that list to make sure that it remains compatible  
```  
class Items:
    def __init__(self, *values):
        self._values = list(values)

    def __len__(self):
        return len(self._values)

    def __getitem__(self, item):
        return self._values.__getitem__(item)
```  

(2) extending the `collections.UserList` base class(inheritance)  
- keep in mind considertions and caveats mentioned in the last part of this chapter  

(3) implementing your own sequence none of above  
- When indexing by a range, the result should be an instance of the same type of the class
- In the range provided by the `slice`, respect the semantics that Python uses, excluding the element at the extending

### 2-2. Context managers
Context managers are a useful feature.  
They correctly respond to a pattern, especially for resource management.  
ex1_1) a simple way of opening files:
```
fd = open(filename)
try:
    process_file(fd)
finally:
    fd.close()
```
ex1_2) a much elegant and Pythonic way:
```
with open(filename) as fd:
    process_file(fd)
```
Context managers consist of two magic methods: `__enter__` and `__exit__`.  

ex2) a possible way of a database backup
```
def stop_database():
    run("systemctl stop postgresql.service")

def start_database():
    run("systemctl start postgresql.service")

class DBHandler:
    def __enter__(self):
        stop_database()
        return self

    def __exit__(self, ex_type, ex_value, ex_traceback):
        start_database()

def db_backup():
    run("pg_dump database")

def main():
    with DBHandler():
        db_backup()
````
> Keep in mind not to accidentally return True on the `__exit__`..  
> If you do, make sure that this is exactly what you want,  
> and that there is a good reason for it.  

### 2-3. Implementing context managers
The `contextlib` module contains a lot of helper functions and objects that can help us write more compact code.  
(1) `contextmanager` decorator  
When the `contextlib.contextmanager` decorator is applied to a function, it converts the code on that function into a context manager.  
The function in question has to be a particular kind of function called a **generator** function, which will separate the statements into what is going to be on the __enter__ and __exit__ magic methods, respectively.
ex1) rewritten code of 2-2. ex2 with the `contextmanager`
```
import contextlib

@contextlib.contextmanager
def db_handler():
    stop_database()
    yield
    start_database()

with db_handler():
    db_backup()
```

(2) `contextlib.ContextDecorator`
This is a mixin base class that provides the logic for applying a decorator to a function that will make it run inside the context manager.  
ex2) extend this class and implement the logic
```
class dbhandler_decorator(contextlib.ContextDecorator):
    def __enter__(self):
        stop_database()

    def __exit__(self, ex_type, ex_value, ex_traceback):
        start_database()

@dbhandler_decorator()
def offline_backup():
    run("pg_dump database")
```
Unlikely 2-2 ex2), there is no `with` statement.  
We just have to call the function, and `offline_backup()` will automatically run inside a context manager.  
As the decorator and the function are completely independent, you cannot get an object that you would like to use inside the context manager.

### 2-4. Properties, attributes, and different types of methods for objects
(1) Underscores in Python  
By default all attributes of an object are public in python.  
Everything that is not strictly part of an object's interface(protected or private) should be kept prefixed with a single underscore (not a double underscore).  
There is a common misconception that some attributes and methods can be actually made private with a double underscore.  
With the double underscores, Python creates a different name for the attribute: `_<class-name>__<attribute-name>`.  
It was created as a means to override different methods of a class that is going to be extended several times, without the risk of having collisions with the method names.  

(2) Properties  
Properties are to be used when we need to define access control to some attributes in an object.  
ex1) an application where users can register only a valid email
```
import re

EMAIL_FORMAT = re.compile(r"[^@]+@[^@]+\.[^@]+")


def is_valid_email(potentially_valid_email: str):
    return re.match(EMAIL_FORMAT, potentially_valid_email) is not none


class User:
    def __init__(self, user_name):
        self.username = user_name
        self._email = none

    @property
    def email(self):
        return self._email

    @email.setter
    def email(self, new_email):
        if not is_valid_email(new_email):
            raise ValueError(f"Can't set {new_email} as it's not a valid email")
            self._email = new_email
```
The above code enables following:
```
>>> u1 = User("jsmith")
>>> u1.email = "jsmith@"
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ValueError: Can't set jsmith@ as it's not a valid email
>>> u1.email = "jsmith@g.co"
>>> u1.email
'jsmith@g.co'
```
The `@property` decorator is the query that will answer to something, and the `@<property_name>.setter` is the command that will do something.  
Methods should do one thing only.  

### 2-5. Iterable objects
We could create our own iterable, with the logic we define for iteration.  
When you try to iterate an object in the form `for e in myobject:...`, what Python checks at a very high level are the following two things, in order:
- If the object contains one of the iterator methods:`__next__` or `__iter__`
- If the object is a sequence and has `__len__` and `__getitem__`

(1) Creating iterable objects  
ex1) iterator object  
```
from datetime import timedelta

class DateRangeIterable:
    """An iterable that contains its own iterator object."""

    def __init__(self, start_date, end_date):
        self.start_date = start_date
        self.end_date = end_date
        self._present_day = start_date

    def __iter__(self):
        return self

    def __next__(self):
        if self._present_day >= self.end_date:
            raise StopIteration
        today = self._present_day
        self._present_day += timedelta(days=1)
        return today
```

```
>>> for day in DateRangeIterable(date(2018, 1, 1), date(2018, 1, 5)):
        print(day)

2018-01-01
2018-01-02
2018-01-03
2018-01-04
>>>
```
This example works, but it has a small problem; once exhausted, the iterable will continue to be empty.  
We can make `__iter__` use a generator, which is being created every time.  
ex1-2) container iterable
```
class DateRangeContainerIterable:
    def __init__(self, start_date, end_date):
        self.start_date = start_date
        self.end_date = end_date

    def __iter__(self):
        current_day = self.start_date
        while current_day < self.end_date:
            yield current_day
            current_day += timedelta(days=1)
```

(2) creating sequences  
The implementation with an iterable will use less memory, but it takes up to O(n) to get an element, whereas implementing a sequence will use more memory, but supports indexing in constant time, O(1).  
ex2) a sequence
```
class DateRangeSequence:
    def __init__(self, start_date, end_date):
        self.start_date = start_date
        self.end_date = end_date
        self._range = self._create_range()

    def _create_range(self):
        days = []
        current_day = self.start_date
        while current_day < self.end_date:
            days.append(current_day)
            current_day += timedelta(days=1)
        return days

    def __getitem__(self, day_no):
        return self._range[day_no]

    def __len__(self):
        return len(self._range)
```

### 2-6. Container objects
Containers are objects that implement a `__contains__` method that usually returns a Boolean value.  
This method is called in the presence of the `in` keyword of Python.
ex1-1) a function to mark some points on a map
```
def mark_coordinate(grid, coord):
    if 0 <= coord.x < grid.width and 0 <= coord.y < grid.height:
        grid[coord] = MARKED
```
ex1-2) the same function with the map itself that has information
```
class Boundaries:
    def __init__(self, width, height):
        self.width = width
        self.height = height

    def __contains__(self, coord):
        x, y = coord
        return 0 <= x < self.width and 0 <= y < self.height


class Grid:
    def __init__(self, width, height):
        self.width = width
        self.height = height
        self.limits = Boundaries(width, height)

    def __contains__(self, coord):
        return coord in self.limits
```
```
def mark_coordinate(grid, coord):
    if coord in grid:
        grid[coord] = MARKED
```

### 2-7. Dynamic attributes
When we call something like <myobject>.<myattribute>, Python will look for <myattribute> in the dictionary of the object, calling `__getattribute__` on it.  
If this is not found (namely, the object does not have the attribute we are looking for), then the extra method, `__getattr__`, is called, passing the name of the attribute (myattribute) as a parameter.  
ex1) dynamic attributes using `__getattr__`  
```
class DynamicAttributes:

    def __init__(self, attribute):
        self.attribute = attribute

    def __getattr__(self, attr):
        if attr.startswith("fallback_"):
            name = attr.replace("fallback_", "")
            return f"[fallback resolved] {name}"
        raise AttributeError(
            f"{self.__class__.__name__} has no attribute {attr}"
```
```
>>> dyn = DynamicAttributes("value")
>>> dyn.attribute
'value'
```
```
>>> dyn.fallback_test
'[fallback resolved] test'
```
Because the object does not have anthing called `fallback_test`, so the `__getattr__` will run with that value.  
Inside that method, we placed the code that returns a string, and what we get is the result of that transformation.  
```
>>> dyn.__dict__["fallback_new"] = "new_value"
>>> dyn.fallback_new
'new value'
```
Because there a new attribute named `fallback_new` is created, so when we request that attribute, notice that the logic we put in `__getattr__` does not apply, simply because that code is never called.  
```
>>> getattr(dyn, "something", "default")
'default'
```
Notice the exception it raises when the value is not retrievable `AttributeError`.  
This is not only for consistency but also required by th built-in `getattr()` function.  
Had this exception been any other, it would raise, and the default value would not be returned.  

### 2-8. Callable objects
The magic method `__call__` will be called when we try to execute our object as if it were a regular function.  
Every argument passed to it will be e passed along to the `__call__` method.  
This method is useful when w e want to create callable objects that will work as parametrized functions, or in some cases functions with memory.  
ex1) an object that returns the number of times it has been called
```
from collections import defaultdict

class CallCount:

    def __init__(self):
        self._counts = defaultdict(int)

    def __call__(self, argument):
        self._counts[argument] += 1
        return self._counts[argument]
```
```
>>> cc = CallCount()
>>> cc(1)
1
>>> cc(2)
1
>>> cc(1)
2
>>> cc(1)
3
>>> cc("something")
1
```
### 2-9. Summary of magic methods
| Statement | Magic method | Python concept |
| --- | --- | --- |
| obj[key], obj[i:j], obj[i:j:k] | `___getitem___(key)` | Subscriptable object |
| with obj: ... | `__enter__/__exit___` | Context manager |
| for i in obj: ... | `__iter__/__next__`, `__len__/__getitem__` | Iterable object, Sequence |
| obj.<attribute> | `__getattr__` | Dynamic attribute retrieval |
| obj(*args, **kwargs) | `__call__(*args, **kwargs)` | Callable object |
